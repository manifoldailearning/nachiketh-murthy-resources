Real client case study: 90 days, $40k burned, 3 failed attempts, 1 success.

What they tried:
→ Attempt 1: Multi-agent system (too complex, couldn't debug)
→ Attempt 2: Single agent (too simple, couldn't scale)
→ Attempt 3: LangGraph (too hard to understand)

What finally worked:
→ Single agent + worker pattern (deployed in 3 weeks)
