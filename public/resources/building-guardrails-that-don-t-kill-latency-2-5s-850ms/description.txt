"Our guardrails add 2.5 seconds to every request."

Here's how to fix it.


- The latency problem (2.5s → 850ms)
- Why sync guardrails kill UX
- Wrong vs right approach
- Where guardrails belong (Pre/Post/HITL)
- PII detection strategy (3 layers)
- Policy enforcement patterns
- The results (3x faster, same safety)

Key insight: Separate what MUST be sync from what CAN be async.
