In the **Agentic AI Enterprise Bootcamp**, we build:
• All 7 layers, production-grade  
• Proper orchestration (retries, idempotency, circuit breakers)  
• Full observability & cost tracking  
• Real deployments — not demos  

📅 Next cohort starts **February 15**

🚨 Most agent systems fail within 48 hours of production deployment.

Not because the LLM is bad.
Not because RAG is broken.
But because critical production layers are missing.

In this video, I walk you through a **Production Readiness Audit** I use to review real-world agent systems.

I recently reviewed 12 production agent deployments.
11 of them had serious gaps.
Most teams didn’t even know what they were missing.

This audit evaluates your system across **7 critical layers** — and gives you a clear score out of 100.

👇 WHAT YOU’LL LEARN
• The full 7-layer production framework for agent systems  
• Why Layers 5 & 6 are where most systems fail  
• How to score your own agent system objectively  
• What different score ranges actually mean in production  
• The most common gaps causing outages and cost overruns

## 🎓 SCORED BELOW 70?
That means your system has **real production risk**.

This video diagnoses the problem.
The bootcamp shows you how to fix it properly.

Systems ship.  
Demos don’t.
