Your agent probably doesn't need long-term memory.

I just saved a client $40,000 by deleting their entire memory system and replacing it with better context assembly.

In this video, I break down:
✓ When long-term memory adds ZERO value
✓ Real cost breakdown ($67K/year for most teams)
✓ The 3-test framework to decide if you need it
✓ Production data: 0.23% impact rate in most cases
✓ When you actually DO need long-term memory

I reviewed 47 production agents last quarter. 39 had long-term memory. Only 7 actually needed it.

The rest were paying $200+/month to impact less than 1% of queries.
