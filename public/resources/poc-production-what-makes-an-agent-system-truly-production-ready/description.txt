Your agent works in POC.
Then production traffic hits… and everything breaks.

In this video, I break down what actually makes an agent system production-ready — beyond demos, test cases, and happy paths.

This is not a tutorial.
This is a production checklist built from real failures, 3 AM incidents, and systems running under load.

You’ll learn:

Why POCs pass tests but fail in production

The 5 pillars of a production-ready agent system

Common gaps between demo architectures and real systems

How to evaluate if your agent is actually ready

A practical migration path from POC → production (without breaking everything)

Covered in detail:

Architecture separation & failure domains

Retry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation

Observability (tracing, cost tracking, alerts)

Security & rate limiting

Compliance & audit logging

Deployment, rollback & incident runbooks

If your agent can’t survive:

API timeouts

Rate limits

Cost spikes at 3 AM

Unexpected user input

Partial system failures

…it’s still a POC, not production.

If you’re serious about shipping production-grade agent systems,
we cover the full implementation (architecture, observability, deployment, and operations) in the Agentic AI Bootcamp.
