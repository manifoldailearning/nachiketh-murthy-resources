    "description": "Your agent tests are probably useless. Not because testing agents is impossible. But because you're testing the wrong things. **The Problem:** - LLM outputs are non-deterministic - Tool calls vary - Conversation flows are dynamic - Traditional `assert response == \"expected\"` fails constantly **The Solution: 3-Layer Testing Framework** **Layer 1: Unit Testing** Test tool functions, not the agent - API calls work correctly - Error handling",
