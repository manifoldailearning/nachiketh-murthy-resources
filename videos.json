    "description": "Your agent's memory strategy is probably costing you thousands per month unnecessarily. The problem: Most teams store everything in a vector database. **Why that's wrong:** - Embedding costs on EVERY message (even \"hi\" and \"thanks\") - 100-200ms retrieval latency for simple lookups - Semantic search for structured data (overkill) **The solution: Hybrid architecture** Short-term memory (conversation history): → Redis / key-value store → $50/month,",
